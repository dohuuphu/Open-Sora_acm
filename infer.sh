The building, a marvel of modern architecture, stands tall against the dark sky, its lights illuminating the surrounding area. The city below is a vibrant display of urban life, with numerous buildings of varying heights contributing to the city's skyline. The scene is further enhanced by the soft glow of streetlights and the twinkling of distant lights, creating a sense of depth and scale. The overall style of the scene is a realistic representation of a city at night, with a focus on the interplay of light and shadow, and the contrast between the illuminated skyscraper and the darker sky." --sample-name "1012_120" --num-sampling-steps 120
